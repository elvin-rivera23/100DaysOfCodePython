# 100DaysOfCodePython
Committing to 100 days of coding in Python, brushing up on programming.

This is a Udemy course that teaches me about programming from the ground up. It's a good refresher for myself since I have not held a role that heavily involves coding on the day-to-day.

Following along as my schedule permits. Doing this with landing a DevOps position as my goal. :)
